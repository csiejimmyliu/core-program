# Week 1 - Cryptographic Basics

## Practical

In each of our modules, we will have a practical component so that you can get some hands-on experience as soon as possible. In this module, we will first start with some basics about circuit writing with Circom.

### Getting Started with Circom (syntax + zkrepl)

In order to get used to writing circuits, we will start with [zkREPL](https://zkrepl.dev/), which is an online REPL that allows you to write and compile Circom circuits in the browser (with no setup required). There are many good videos on Circom, such as this one:

- [Circom Workshop 1 by 0xParc [1:31:06]](https://learn.0xparc.org/materials/circom/learning-group-1/circom-1/) - A very good introduction to Circom circuits.

However, we recommend you work through a few of the following example scenarios with zkREPL first. This way you can gain some familiarity with the syntax without having to setup the environment and dig into too much detail. Afterwards, you can review the video and fill in any gaps.

#### Hello World - Addition

This is one of the simplest examples of a ZK circuit. This circuit checks that the `sum` is the addition of two numbers `a` and `b`. Copy-and-paste the following into zkREPL, and compile it in the browser.

```circom
pragma circom 2.1.6;

template AdditionProof() {
    // declaration of signals
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output sum;

    // constraint
    sum <== a + b;
}

component main = AdditionProof();

/* INPUT = {
    "a": 3,
    "b": 5
} */
```

Note that the `a` and `b` are the private inputs.

### Write a circuit to prove multiplication

From there, let's try to write a circuit to prove the multiplication of two numbers!

Once that works, try to make a circuit to prove the multiplication of three numbers.

Make sure to save these circuits and present them at the end of the week.

```circom
pragma circom 2.1.6;

template Multiplication2() {
    // declaration of signals
    signal input in1;
    signal input in2;
    signal output out;

    // constraint
    out <== in1 * in2;
}

template Multiplication3() {
    // declaration of signals
    signal input in1;
    signal input in2;
    signal input in3;

    component mult1 = Multiplication2();
    component mult2 = Multiplication2();

    signal output out;

    // constraint
    mult1.in1 <== in1;
    mult1.in2 <== in2;
    mult2.in1 <== mult1.out;
    mult2.in2 <== in3;
    out <== mult2.out;
}

component main = Multiplication3();

/* INPUT = {
    "in1": 3,
    "in2": 5,
    "in3": 4
} */
```


### Write a circuit to prove input to hash

Now let's take it to the next level, we will write a circuit to prove the input to a hash. In order to do this, we will use the Poseidon hashing algorithm. You will need to include the following line at the top:

```circom
include "circomlib/poseidon.circom";
```

Here's how you'd use the Poseidon hashing function:

```circom
component hasher = Poseidon(1);
hasher.inputs[0] <== preimage;
hashOutput <== hasher.out;
```

You might want to research what a `component` is in the Circom syntax.

Use this as the input:

```circom
/* INPUT = {
    "preimage": "12345",
    "hash": "4267533774488295900887461483015112262021273608761099826938271132511348470966"
} */
```

Save the full answer to be submitted at the end of this module!

```circom
template Hash(){
    signal input preimage;
    signal input hash;
    signal output hashOutput;

    component hasher = Poseidon(1);

    hasher.inputs[0] <== preimage;
    hashOutput <== hasher.out;
}

component main = Hash();

/* INPUT = {
    "preimage": "12345",
    "hash": "4267533774488295900887461483015112262021273608761099826938271132511348470966"
} */
```

### Write a circuit to add two numbers on an elliptic curve

We don't dive in the details of elliptic curves in this module, but we can still write a simple circuit to add two numbers on an elliptic curve by importing the `babyjub.circom` file and add the points together.
Link to this code is [here](https://gist.github.com/NOOMA-42/1a9040d49a0a828075971cb50acc4adb)

```circom
// Code modified from circomlib test
pragma circom 2.1.6;

include "circomlib/circuits/babyjub.circom";

template AddNumOnEllipticCurve() {
    signal input x1;
    signal input y1;
    signal input x2;
    signal input y2;
    // To check xout yout
    signal input xout;
    signal input yout;
    component babyAdd = BabyAdd();
    babyAdd.x1 <== x1;
    babyAdd.y1 <== y1;
    babyAdd.x2 <== x2;
    babyAdd.y2 <== y2;
    xout === babyAdd.xout;
    yout === babyAdd.yout;
}

component main = AddNumOnEllipticCurve();

/* INPUT = {
    "x1": "17777552123799933955779906779655732241715742912184938656739573121738514868268",
    "y1": "2626589144620713026669568689430873010625803728049924121243784502389097019475",
    "x2": "17777552123799933955779906779655732241715742912184938656739573121738514868268",
    "y2": "2626589144620713026669568689430873010625803728049924121243784502389097019475",
    "xout": "6890855772600357754907169075114257697580319025794532037257385534741338397365",

} */
```

### Write a circuit to prove inclusion in Merkle tree

TtheBC01 has a good example of a Merkle tree circuit [here](https://github.com/TtheBC01/zkSNARK-playground/blob/main/examples/merkle-tree/tree.circom)

The main component is Poseidon hash. Poseidon hash maps sequences of elements to a fixed-length sequence of elements. You can use it to hash messages of arbitrary length or fixed length (such as in a Merkle tree, where typically two elements are hashed). Here you initialize the Poseidon hash with n = 2

You may also need a Mux. Mux is a component that takes two inputs and outputs one of them based on a selector. In this case, the selector is the index of the element in the Merkle tree.
```circom
poseidons[i] = Poseidon(2);
mux[i] = MultiMux1(2);
```

Here is the example of TtheBC01:

```circom
pragma circom 2.0.0;

include "../../../circomlib/circuits/poseidon.circom";
include "../../../circomlib/circuits/mux1.circom";

template MerkleTreeInclusionProof(nLevels) {
    signal input leaf;
    signal input pathIndices[nLevels];
    signal input siblings[nLevels];

    signal output root;

    component poseidons[nLevels];
    component mux[nLevels];

    signal hashes[nLevels + 1];
    hashes[0] <== leaf;

    for (var i = 0; i < nLevels; i++) {
        pathIndices[i] * (1 - pathIndices[i]) === 0;

        poseidons[i] = Poseidon(2);
        mux[i] = MultiMux1(2);

        mux[i].c[0][0] <== hashes[i];
        mux[i].c[0][1] <== siblings[i];

        mux[i].c[1][0] <== siblings[i];
        mux[i].c[1][1] <== hashes[i];

        mux[i].s <== pathIndices[i];

        poseidons[i].inputs[0] <== mux[i].out[0];
        poseidons[i].inputs[1] <== mux[i].out[1];

        hashes[i + 1] <== poseidons[i].out;
    }

    root <== hashes[nLevels];
}

component main = MerkleTreeInclusionProof(20);
```

### Tips

You can always reference circomlib for examples of how to use existing circuits. You can find the circomlib [here](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib). Writing a simple circuit is not too dififcult, but it can be a bit tricky to get the constraints right and optimize the circuit. circomlib has many examples that you can use as a reference.

## Study

### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption (AES, RSA)

Encryption is a technique used to encode data, making it readable only to those who possess the correct decryption key. There are two main types of encryption - symmetric and asymmetric, each serving different purposes and with their own strengths and weaknesses.

**Symmetric Encryption** - Also known as single-key encryption, this method involves using the same key for both encryption and decryption. The most widely used symmetric encryption algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

**Asymmetric Encryption** - Also known as public-key encryption, this method uses a pair of keys: one for encryption and another for decryption. The RSA algorithm is one of the best known public-key algorithms.

The key difference between the two is the number of keys used: symmetric encryption uses one key for both encrypting and decrypting, while asymmetric encryption uses a different key for each (one public, one private). For a deeper understanding of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, please explore these resources:

:::info
**ðŸ¤” Consider the following:**
1. What is the primary difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
2. Can you briefly explain how AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) works?
3. What makes RSA a popular choice for public-key encryption? :::

**Ans:**
1. Symmetric algorithm requires two sender and receiver sharing the same key, thus needing to do secret key exchange at first.
Asymmetric algorithm has public key and secret key, public key is published online, these two keys can decrypt messages encrypted by each other.
2. AES cuts the message into bytes, fills these bytes in a 4X4 array, each round will (adding round key, substitution, shifting row and mixing column).
3. Easy to implement and use for both encryption and digital signatures.


### Hash Functions, Merkle Trees

#### Hash Functions

A hash function takes an input and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. **SHA-256** and **Poseidon** are popular cryptographic hash functions in our context, with Poseidon specifically designed for arithmetic-friendly operations, benefiting certain applications in blockchains.

The primary characteristics of a good hash function are [preimage resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack), second preimage resistance, and [collision resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance), ensuring data security and integrity. In blockchain technology, hash functions create an unalterable, unique representation of each block's content, contributing to the immutability and transparency of the system.

:::info
**ðŸ¤” Consider the following:**
1. What is a hash function and what are its primary uses in cryptography?
2. How does the SHA-256 hashing algorithm function, in simple terms?
3. What is the Poseidon hash function and why is it particularly useful in ZKPs?
:::

**Ans:**
1. Hash is a one-way function, mapping arbitrary-length messages into a fixed-length digest which is useful in authucation.
2. Turn msg into binary then use msg as a round key to modify fixed-length initial bits.
3. Poseidon is a hash function on a finite field with sponge structure, which is flexible in the trade-off between throughput and security by manipulating rate and capacity.
The circuits needed in Poseidon are much less than SHA-256 in ZKPs.

#### Merkle Trees

A Merkle tree is a core component of blockchain and cryptography. It's a binary tree filled with cryptographic hashes. This structure enables efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. To understand more about Merkle trees, read the following:

1. Can you describe the structure of a Merkle tree?
2. How are Merkle trees used within the blockchain context?
3. Why are Merkle trees useful for efficient and secure verification of large data structures?
:::

**Ans:**
1. Merkle tree is a binary tree, each node of the Merkle tree is a hash value, and the father node is the hash value of two children.
2. We use Merkle tree to verify transitions, also using Merkle proof as ZKP.
3. We verify a proof by checking the path to the root, which only needs O(logn) complexity.

### Digital Signatures (Schnorr)

Digital signatures ensure the integrity and authenticity of digital messages or documents. By providing a means to verify the origin and confirm that the content has not been altered, digital signatures play a pivotal role in maintaining trust in digital communications.

In PKC, anyone can encrypt their message with the receiver's public key, and only the receiver can decrypt the message with their private key. In digital signatures, on the other hand, if a signer generates a signature for a message using their private key, anyone can validate it using the signer's public key. Therefore, the message of the signature is made public, which distinguishes it from cryptographic commitments.

:::

**Ans:**
1. Digital signatures are like real-world signatures in the computer field. We can use it to check the identification and verification.
2. Alice has plaintext C and private key SK, Alice sends C and e(H(C)) to Bob, Bob can hash C get H(C), and decrypt e(H(C)) to check if H(C) matches.

### DLP-based Public-Key Cryptography (DLP, DH, Elgamal)

While RSA encryption is based on the hardness of factoring problem, there is another public key cryptography system based on hardness of Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP).

1. **Discrete Log Problem (DLP):** This is a cornerstone problem in public-key cryptography and underlies many key exchange and encryption algorithms. Understanding DLP provides a foundation for the remaining topics.

    - [Public key cryptography using discrete logarithms](https://www.di-mgt.com.au/public-key-crypto-discrete-logs-0.html)

2. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:** This is one of the earliest practical implementations of key exchange protocols based on the Discrete Log Problem. It's critical to understand how secure communication can be established over insecure channels.

    This protocol is significant as it enables secure communication over insecure channels by allowing two parties to generate a shared secret key, which can then be used for encryption and decryption of messages

    - [Implementation of Diffie-Hellman Algorithm

3. **ElGamal Encryption:** This is a public-key encryption method that utilizes the principles of DLP. This will allow you to see a practical application of these abstract concepts in a real-world encryption scheme.

:::info
**ðŸ¤” Consider the following:**
1. What is the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)?
2. How does the Diffie-Hellman protocol work?
3. What is the main idea behind ElGamal encryption?
4. Can you name a drawback of using DLP-based systems?
:::

**Ans:**
1. Assuming A=g^a mod p, DLP is the problem that is so hard to recover a by knowing A.
2. Alice and Bob share generator g and prime p. They have private keys a and b on their own. Alice sends A=g^a mod p to Bob and Bob sends B=g^b mod p to Alice. Alice now has B^a and Bob has A^b which are the same(g^ab mod p), this is a shared secret key.
3. With a private key receiver can decrypt a message by eliminating the random number the sender chooses.
4. square calculation is computationally consuming.

### Cryptographic Commitments

Cryptographic commitments are essential in cryptography and blockchain technology as they allow for selective hiding and revealing of information. This feature ensures data privacy while still enabling verification processes.

It helps achieve secure and efficient verification of transactions in blockchain protocols. In such contexts, sensitive information, such as transaction details or user identities, is hidden while revealing others for the verifier to authenticate the transactions.

You can break down the concept of commitment into two parts: commit and open (reveal).

![commitment scheme](./assets/commitment.png)
[Source](https://zecrey.medium.com/commmitment-schemes-in-zecrey-e6c446e2da97)

There is always a commit phase and a reveal phase, in other words you first encrypt a secret and then reveal it later.

#### Pedersen Commitments (Optional)
Pedersen Commitments are a type of cryptographic primitive that allows you to commit to a certain value while keeping it hidden, with the ability to disclose the committed value later. They're often used to achieve privacy-preserving properties in cryptographic protocols. For more on Pedersen Commitments, review these materials:

- [Pedersen Commitments](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/ped)
- [What is a Pedersen Commitment?](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/64437/what-is-a-pedersen-commitment)

As a final touch on this section, [this video [10:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkNZWJFcfcU) provides a brief yet comprehensive summary of the fundamental concepts discussed in this section.

1. What is the main purpose of Cryptographic Commitments?
2. What type of information does a Polynomial Commitment hide and reveal?
3. How do Pedersen Commitments contribute to privacy in cryptography?
4. Why are Cryptographic Commitments important in blockchain technology?
:::

**Ans:**
1. Commitment is like a sealed envelope, we can reveal the message later.
2. It hides the coefficients and reveals where a polynomial evaluates to a certain value at a specific point.
3. It has hiding and binding properties while also being able to accumulate commitment.
4. Ensuring data integrity, and privacy, and enabling to verify. 

### Intro to Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Elliptic curve cryptography builds upon traditional cryptographic principles by applying them to the mathematical structure of elliptic curves.

For example, there exists an **Elliptic Curve Discrete Log Problem (ECDLP)**. By using elliptic curves, it has certain benefits over the regular Discrete Log Problem (DLP). These links are a good place to start:

- [Elliptic Curves - Computerphile [8:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF1pwjL9-DE)
- [A (relatively easy to understand) primer on elliptic curve cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/)

**Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)** extends the traditional Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) by incorporating elliptic curves as well, enabling stronger security with shorter key lengths. This makes the algorithm more efficient and suitable for constrained environments. ECDSA is widely used in various secure communication protocols, including SSL/TLS.

The following StackExchange answer goes over the differences between some of the most popular digital signature protocols. It also leads into our next topic, which is another type of digital signature called the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).

- [What is the difference between the RSA, DSA, and ECDSA keys that ssh uses?](https://askubuntu.com/a/1000928/733503)

### BLS Signatures

BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signatures are a type of cryptographic signature scheme that allows for efficient aggregation of individual signatures into a single signature. It also makes use of pairing-based cryptography.

The intuition of BLS is that it is an aggregation signature. The image below shows how the public key and signature are aggregated. The advantage is that all signatures can be verified at once. That's why it is commonly used in consensus protocols.

[Source](https://www.inevitableeth.com/en/home/concepts/bls-signatures)

### Pairing-Based Cryptography

Pairing-based cryptography underly many of the following topics. So it is important to know what it is, even if you might not need to know the specifics.

You can imagine pairing as the multiplication of elliptic curves. The original elliptic curve operation is homomorphically additive but not homomorphically multiplicative. Pairing is a way to mimic this "multiplication".

This is largely used in ZKPs, especially during the verification stage.
